Raicart is our in-house wheeled robot platform designed for outdoor navigation tasks.
The dimensions of the robot are 770mm x 500mm x 480mm, including the Zed2 camera mount, and the weight is 14kg. 
Raicart demonstrates robust capabilities in traversing unpaved outdoor terrain with utmost stability.
The system adeptly changes its heading direction through Ackerman steering, effectively preventing the tires from
slipping sideways while maneuvering through curves. 
All computations and data collection was conducted on NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier, a small and powerful embedded PC.
