Learning-based Control
********************************

Legged robots often face challenges due to their high degrees of freedom and the difficulty of accurately modeling complex environments. These factors discourage the development of robust and stable controllers. However, by leveraging reinforcement learning(RL) techniques, we have successfully developed locomotion controllers that enable the quadrupedal robots to adapt and traverse through challenging terrains such as rough, slippery, and deformable surfaces. This learning-based approach not only improves robustness and stability but also reduces dependency on accruate and computationally intensive models, making our controllers well-suited for practical applications in dynamic and unpredictable environments.

Raibo, made by Railab, has hardware that can withstand shocks under various conditions and operate robustly regardless of the environment. 
We also design its own driving units, which are key components consisting of decelerators, motors, encoders, and motor drivers. 
With its own form factor, it plays a major role in achieving high efficiency during operation.

We are rigorously pursuing research in the electronics sector for pushing hardware utilization to the extreme. Our research extends from designing power circuit, crucial for handling inrush currents and regenerative braking during impacts, to high-power, high-bandwidth motor drivers. The circuit design, artwork, SMT, and testing are all performed in-house.

Leveraging our deep understanding of power electronics and robotic systems, we are not just enabling robots to utilize the extreme area of motor capabilities, but also contributing to bridging the sim-to-real gap. Furthermore, taking into account the characteristics of each electronics component, we can build high power and low noise motor driver in a small form factor and facilitate it into efficient locomotion.
